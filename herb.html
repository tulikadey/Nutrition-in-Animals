     <!-- <h3 class="tihe">1.  Who Are Herbivores Animals?</h3> -->
     <p class="tihea">Herbivores is an animal which only eats vegitation like grasses, fruits, leaves, vegetables,
          roots and bulbs.Herbivores only eat things that need photosynthesis to live. This excludes insects, spiders,
           fish and other animals. </p>
           <br>
           <h2 class="tihe">These are the six main types of herbivores:

            <br>
            <p class="tihea">There are many different types of herbivores. Many eat a variety of plants, while some stick to one type of plant. Those who s
                tick to one type of plant have their own special classifications.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Size</h1>
        <p class="tihea">Herbivores can be very large or very small. The world’s largest herbivore is the African 
            elephant. It can grow to 8.2 to 13 feet (2.5 to 4 meters) from foot to shoulder and weigh 5,000 to 14,000 lbs. (2,268 to 6,
            350 kilograms).The world's smallest herbivore may be the featherwing beetle. It measures just 0.0127 inches (0.325 millimeters) according to Discovery. The featherwing eats molds
             and fungi it finds in moist, organic materials, such as compost heaps, decaying logs, animal dung, sea weed on sea shores and under leaves.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Herbivore digestive system</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Herbivores can often have several stomach chambers and a much longer digestive tract. Herbivores with multiple
             stomach chambers — such as camels, deer, sheep, giraffes and cattle — are called ruminants.Plant cells are tough, and the cellulose 
             that makes up their cell walls is difficult to digest. Digestion starts with the teeth.

        <section id="teeth">
            <h2 class="title">Teeth</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Herbivores have broad, flat molars (back teeth) with rough surfaces, which are used for grinding up tough plant tissues. Many 
            herbivores (like squirrels) have chisel-like front
             teeth used for gnawing through wood or hard seeds. These teeth grow continually to avoid being worn down with use.Herbivores have large, flat teeth that grind up plant materials. The herbivores do the hard job of processing the energy that comes from plant life.  </p>

            <h2 class="title">Nutrition in Herbivores</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Herbivores are able to consume diets relatively high in fiber and low in protein. Herbivores may be divided into foregut and hindgut fermenters. ... Hindgut fermetation allows consumption of food items containing high levels of secondary plant compounds like alkaloids, oxalates, tannins, and terpenes.Herbivores eat plants, and their digestive system has adapted to absorb nutrients from plant material. Long Digestive Tracts; Plant material is difficult to digest, particularly plant cellulose.</p>
