     <!-- <h3 class="tihe">1.  Who Are carnivores Animals?</h3> -->
     <p class="tihea">A carnivore is an animal that mostly eats meat, or the flesh of animals. Sometimes carnivores are called predators. Organisms that carnivores hunt are called prey.
    </p>
           <br>
           <h3 class="tihe">While all carnivores eat other animals, they don’t always have the same diet. You can get more specific with the type of 
               carnivore you’re talking about by looking at its prey. Different types of carnivores include:

       <h2 class="title">Physical Adaptations of Carnivores Animals</h2>
        <p class="tihea">The physical features of the carnivores are what makes them so different from other animals. It is indeed what makes them such great hunters and consumers. The eyes of carnivores are located on the front of their heads; it allows them to hunt effectively.

            Moreover, it also allows them to have depth perception. It is quite an essential asset for hunting because it lets the animal determine from far away from the distance of their prey and their speed. Furthermore, most of the carnivores have sharp teeth and powerful jaws.
            
            It allows them to bite the meat effectively and also hold down strong prey without any trouble. In other words, carnivores have sharp incisors and canines, unlike herbivores. This helps them in ripping the meat better from their prey.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Land Carnivores</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Land-dwelling carnivores have evolved for optimal hunting behavior. 
            These adaptations include keen eyesight, bendable wrists for jumping after prey, and high levels of speed for outrunning animals.
             Carnivores on the land may hunt other land-based animals, or they might catch swimming or flying animals as well.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Teeth</h3>
           <h3 class="tihea"> Most carnivores have long, sharp teeth adapted to ripping, 
               tearing or cutting flesh. While many also possess a few molars in the back of their mouths,
                and sharp incisors in the front, the most important teeth for carnivores are their long, sharp canine teeth.</h3>

            <h2 class="title">Aquatic Carnivores</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Meat-eating animals live in the water, too. Both saltwater and freshwater carnivores get their food by hunting and eating fish, amphibians, crustaceans,
             and other herbivorous and omnivorous animals. Ocean, river, lake, and pond ecosystems all depend on carnivores to stay balanced. </p>
             <h3 class="tihe">Here are some examples of aquatic meat-eating animals in saltwater and freshwater habitats:</h3>
            <h3 class="tihed">alligator</h3>

            <h2 class="title">Flying Carnivores</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Many carnivores swoop down on their prey from the skies. These skilled hunters are always searching the ground for small insects and animals. They use sharp, hooked beaks and talons to grab and eat their prey.
             Insectivorous birds, such as sparrows, bluebirds, and swallows, have blunt beaks that are ideal for catching worms and other invertebrates. </p>

            <h2 class="title">Nutrition in Carnivores</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Carnivores are also able to utilize animal fat. If their prey is small, they can chew and swallow bones, which serve as a source of calcium. Some carnivores, particularly cats (family Felidae), are obligate carnivores, meaning they cannot obtain all the nutrients that they need from the plant kingdom and bacteria.</p>
