     <!-- <h3 class="tihe">1.  Who Are Omnivores Animals?</h3> -->
     <p class="tihea">Any animal that can eat both plants and animals is an omnivore. People are omnivores, containing with flat and sharp teeth and the ability to digest meat, fruit, and vegetables for food. Bears 
         are another example of omnivores as they eat both berries and meat. Medium-size omnivores include animals like raccoons, pigs and chickens.

       <h2 class="title">Teeth</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Often, teeth can be a giveaway as to what category an animal fits. This isn't always the case, but herbivores more typically have flatter teeth for grinding up vegetation, while carnivores will have sharp teeth for tearing up meat. Many omnivores will have some combination of the two, allowing for easier eating and digestion of their food sources.</p>

            <h2 class="title"> Diet and Features</h2>
        <p class="tihea"> Both animal and plant materials are the main food in an omnivorous diet. Animals with this type of diet have distinct characteristics. For instance, they lack the specialized storage and digestive sacs (e.g. crops and fermenting vats) that are common in herbivores.  They also do not have the sharp long teeth of carnivores that the latter use for capturing and tearing out the flesh of their prey. Similarly, herbivores do not have carnivorous teeth since they do not need to chase down their food. Nevertheless, some of the herbivores, e.g. beavers, can grow their teeth continuously throughout their lifetime. That is because some plant materials (e.g. cellulose) are highly abrasive to their teeth.  Omnivores cannot regrow teeth as many times as some herbivores can. Nevertheless, their teeth are efficient for opening fruits and eating less abrasive plant material</p>

                <h2 class="title"> Nutrition</h2>
            <p class="tihea"> An omnivore is an animal that has the ability to eat and survive on both plant and animal matter. Obtaining energy and nutrients from plant and animal
                 matter, omnivores digest carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fiber, and metabolize the nutrients and energy of the sources absorbed.An omnivore is an Animal that regularly
                  consumes a variety of material, including plants, animals, algae, and fungi. They range in size from tiny insects like ants to large creaturesâ€”like people. Human beings are omnivores. People eat plants, such as vegetables and fruits.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Types of Carnivores</h3>
           <h3 class="tihea"> Most carnivores have long, sharp teeth adapted to ripping, 
               tearing or cutting flesh. While many also possess a few molars in the back of their mouths,
                and sharp incisors in the front, the most important teeth for carnivores are their long, sharp canine teeth.</h3>

            <h2 class="title">Aquatic Carnivores</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Meat-eating animals live in the water, too. Both saltwater and freshwater carnivores get their food by hunting and eating fish, amphibians, crustaceans,
             and other herbivorous and omnivorous animals. Ocean, river, lake, and pond ecosystems all depend on carnivores to stay balanced. </p>

            <h2 class="title">Flying Carnivores</h2>
        <p class="tihea">Many carnivores swoop down on their prey from the skies. These skilled hunters are always searching the ground for small insects and animals. They use sharp, hooked beaks and talons to grab and eat their prey.
             Insectivorous birds, such as sparrows, bluebirds, and swallows, have blunt beaks that are ideal for catching worms and other invertebrates. </p>
